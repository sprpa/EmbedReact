Mes Project is developing by using Rect as a frontend and backend as a python flask 
application and these two are interlinked by the APIs for using the 
CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete ) operations.


JWT 

Jwt is json web token  which is used to authenticate users in an application. It allows secure 
communication between the user's
The JWT (JSON Web Token) library was used to handle user authentication in this project.
It provides an easy way of securely transmitting information.


We autherize the  user with JWT which stands for JSON Web Tokens. 
It's an open standard that allows you to securely transmit data between parties as decryptet code

Now The jwt tokens are implementing in the bakend  part i.e., Python Flask Application.

For that we install the package in python : pip install pyjwt


in the first thing  when the user signup or login it will generate a token .
and then every request made from the client side should carry this token in the header.

This implementation helps us to identify who is making the request so that we can provide access accordingly.
